### Hello there! 👋

I am a beginner in the web development and do my best to become a better version of myself every day. 

Thanks to [BeCode](https://github.com/becodeorg), I started my development jorney in September 2021 and it's gonna be something or I am not I am. 
I see myself more as a Frontend, I like how everything looks, you know, but I also got known of Backend and understand the core. 

I'm currently looking for the opportunity to learn more as an intern in some nice company in Belgium. 
If you are that company - please, contact me ezhgurova@gmail.com or here is my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katyaheylen/). 

**Here you can see my stats:**
